        <h2>My Short Story & Journey</h2>
        <p id="story-text">How did I end up in tech? Well, I can confidently say that no matter how many times I deviated, the path always led me back. Here‚Äôs my story.

My first serious interaction with a computer was in high school, during my computer studies class. Sounds great, right? Well, it didn‚Äôt last long as I soon found myself in serious trouble. Why? Because instead of revising for CAT exams, I was busy racing through Need for Speed: Most Wanted(Favorite game back then). But now that‚Äôs not the actual problem. The real issue was my terrible tab-switching reflexes.I wish I had known the work of Alt + Tab back then. Too bad I couldn't save myself and now there was computer teacher, already standing behind me. Busted.

As a result, I was given lab cleaning duty as punishment. Innocently, I asked if there was an alternative sentence, and that‚Äôs how I ended up finding myself taking Business Studies instead. Why did I pick switching subjects over cleaning labs? To this day, I still have no idea. But atleast, I got the opportunity to focus on Physics, which became my favorite subject and later on my gateway to Computer Science.

Fast forward to university, and once again, I was at a crossroads. I had to choose between Actuarial Science (backed by my Business Studies grade) and Computer Science (backed by my Physics grade). This time, the choice wasn‚Äôt based on avoiding lab cleaning. I decided to rekindle my long-lost love for tech and went for Computer Science.

Like every other computer scientist who has ever existed (except maybe Charles Babbage and Alan Turing), my first program was a simple one:

print("Hello, World!")
And that little moment of magic changed everything.

From then on, I was hooked. My journey in tech, AI, and data science officially began. It has been nothing short of exhilarating, and I‚Äôve never looked back.

So, join me on this adventure. And don‚Äôt worry, I won‚Äôt make you clean any labs. üòÜ</p>
