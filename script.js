My first real interaction with a computer was in high school, during my computer studies class. Sounds great, right? Well, it didnâ€™t last longâ€”I soon found myself in serious trouble. Why? Because instead of revising for CAT exams, I was busy racing through Need for Speed: Most Wanted. Now, thatâ€™s not the actual problemâ€”the real issue was my terrible tab-switching reflexes. Before I could hit Alt + Tab, my computer teacher was already standing behind me. Busted.

As a result, I was given lab cleaning duty as punishment. Naturally, I asked if there was an alternative sentenceâ€”and thatâ€™s how I suddenly found myself taking Business Studies instead. Why did I pick switching subjects over cleaning labs? To this day, I have no idea.

Fast forward to university, and once again, I was at a crossroads. I had to choose between Actuarial Science (backed by my Business Studies grade) and Computer Science (backed by my Physics grade). This time, at least, the choice wasnâ€™t based on avoiding lab cleaning. I decided to rekindle my long-lost love for tech and went for Computer Science.

Like every other computer scientist who has ever existed (except maybe Charles Babbage and Alan Turing), my first program was a simple one:

print("Hello, World!")
And that little moment of magic changed everything.

From then on, I was hooked. My journey in tech, AI, and data science has been nothing short of exhilarating, and Iâ€™ve never looked back.

So, join me on this adventureâ€”donâ€™t worry, I wonâ€™t make you clean any labs. ðŸ˜†";
